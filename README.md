# Fraud-detection-in-mobile-ADs-using-ML

## Background
Click fraud is the act of illegally clicking on pay-per-click (PPC) ads to increase site revenue or to exhaust a company's advertising budget. Click fraud is different from invalid clicks (those that are repeated or made by the ad's host/publisher) in that it is intentional, malicious, and has no potential for the ad to result in a sale. Click fraud happens with
pay-per-click advertising and may involve either a human, a computer program, or an automated script pretending to be a legitimate user and clicking on paid search advertising with no intention of purchasing something. Fraud risk is everywhere, but for companies that advertise online, click fraud can happen at an overwhelming volume, resulting in misleading click data and wasted money. Ad channels can drive up costs by simply clicking on the ad at a large scale. With over 5.3 billion smart mobile devices in active use every month, the world therefore suffers from huge volumes of fraudulent traffic

## Aim
In this project we aim to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app ad by analyzing and finding patterns on user behavior such as the type of device owned by them, the id of the advertisement publisher. By doing so, we aim at finding such fraudulent companies and blacklisting them as prevention is always better than cure.
